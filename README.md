# Sky Ecosystem Documentation — Laniakea Upgrade

Technical documentation for Sky Ecosystem and the Laniakea upgrade — a comprehensive infrastructure overhaul rolling out through 2026.

## What is Laniakea?

Laniakea is Sky's infrastructure for **automated capital deployment at scale**. It introduces:

- **Unified capital flow architecture** — Capital flows from Sky Core → Primes → Halos → end investments, with every flow rate-limited
- **Scientific risk management** — Basel III-inspired framework determining capital requirements based on asset duration and forced realization probability
- **Autonomous operation** — Sentinel network operates infrastructure within governance-defined bounds, enabling 99% automation
- **Daily settlement cycles** — Standardized daily cycles for auctions, distributions, and LCTS token settlement (lock 13:00 UTC, settle by 16:00 UTC)

This repository provides a complete view of all future Laniakea upgrades alongside current Sky Ecosystem parameters and features.
