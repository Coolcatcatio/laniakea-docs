# Implementation Roadmap

Phased implementation plan for Laniakea infrastructure, from Phase 0 legacy exceptions through full autonomous operation with Sentinel formations in Phase 10. The progression follows three stages: foundational infrastructure (Phases 0-4), factory systems for scalable deployment (Phases 5-8), and full automation through Sentinel formations (Phases 9-10).

Start with [`roadmap-overview.md`](roadmap-overview.md) for the complete summary including dependency graph, key milestones, and beacon taxonomy reference.
