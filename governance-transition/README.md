# Governance Transition: Alignment Conserver Consolidation

Plan for consolidating Sky's three alignment-conserver roles into a single **Guardian** role.

## Context

Sky governance previously operated with three alignment-conserver roles — Facilitators, Aligned Delegates, and Guardians (formerly Executors) — each handling distinct governance functions. These have been consolidated into a single Guardian role that combines interpretation, governance participation, and operational execution with collateral-backed accountability.

This directory documents the legacy model, the target model, and the transition between them.
