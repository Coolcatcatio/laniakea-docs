# Transition Plan: Three Roles to One

Phased migration from the legacy three-role alignment-conserver model (Facilitators, Aligned Delegates, Guardians) to the target single-role model (Guardians only).

---

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name | Focus | Prerequisite |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Facilitator Absorption | Core Guardians take over Atlas interpretation | Guardian Accord updates |
| **2** | Delegate Consolidation | Core Guardians absorb delegated voting power | Phase 1 complete; delegation mechanism updates |
| **3** | Role Retirement | Facilitator and Aligned Delegate roles formally retired | Phase 2 complete; governance vote |

---

## Phase 1: Facilitator Absorption

Core Guardians assume responsibility for Atlas interpretation, replacing Facilitators as the interpretive authority.

### Actions

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Update Guardian Accord | Add interpretation duties, precedent-creation authority, and "Spirit of the Atlas" responsibility to Core Guardian scope |
| Collateral adjustment | Review whether Core Guardian collateral requirements need to increase to cover interpretive accountability |
| Precedent migration | Transfer existing Facilitator Action Precedents to Guardian Action Precedents; establish continuity |
| Knowledge transfer | Ensure Core Guardians have access to all historical interpretations and context |
| Dual-operation period | Facilitators and Core Guardians operate in parallel during transition; Facilitators available for consultation |

### Governance Changes

- Atlas Edit Cycle trigger authority transfers from Facilitators to Core Guardians
- Governance Poll proposal authority extends to Core Guardians
- Facilitator Framework section in Atlas updated to reference Guardian interpretation

### Completion Criteria

- Core Guardians successfully creating and documenting Guardian Action Precedents
- No active reliance on Facilitator interpretive authority
- Facilitators available only in advisory capacity

---

## Phase 2: Delegate Consolidation

SKY voting delegation redirected from Aligned Delegates to Core Guardians.

### Actions

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Delegate Contract updates | Core Guardians register as eligible delegation targets (may reuse existing Delegate Contracts or deploy new ones) |
| Delegation migration | SKY holders redirect delegations from Aligned Delegates to Core Guardians (voluntary; existing delegations remain valid until changed) |
| Ranking integration | Core Guardian ranking incorporates delegated voting power (L1-L3 structure retained) |
| Compensation alignment | Budget allocations for governance activity apply to Core Guardians under unified compensation model |
| Communication | Clear messaging to SKY holders about delegation changes and new targets |

### Governance Changes

- Aligned Delegate System section in Atlas updated to reference Core Guardian delegation
- Voting activity requirements integrated into Guardian Accord
- Budget allocation formulas updated for unified role

### Completion Criteria

- Majority of delegated voting power redirected to Core Guardians
- Core Guardians actively participating in governance votes
- No functional dependency on Aligned Delegate role

---

## Phase 3: Role Retirement

Formal governance vote to retire the Facilitator and Aligned Delegate roles.

### Actions

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Governance proposal | Executive Vote to formally retire Facilitator and Aligned Delegate roles |
| Atlas updates | Remove Facilitator Framework and Aligned Delegate System as separate sections; integrate into Guardian documentation |
| Glossary updates | Update [Appendix F](../whitepaper/appendix-f-glossary.md) to mark Facilitator and Aligned Delegate as legacy terms |
| Synome cleanup | Remove separate role registries; consolidate into Guardian registry |
| Final Facilitator/Delegate exit | Remaining Facilitators and Aligned Delegates either transition to Core Guardian role or exit |

### Governance Changes

- Atlas documents modified via Atlas Edit Cycle
- Appendix A and Appendix B sections updated
- Agent Artifacts referencing Facilitators or Aligned Delegates updated

### Completion Criteria

- Executive Vote passed
- Atlas updated to reflect single-role model
- No remaining references to Facilitator or Aligned Delegate as active roles (legacy references preserved in glossary)

## Risk Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Knowledge loss** during Facilitator absorption | Precedent migration and dual-operation period ensure continuity |
| **Delegation disruption** during consolidation | Voluntary migration; existing delegations remain valid until redirected |
| **Governance participation drop** during transition | Clear communication; budget incentives maintained throughout |
| **Collateral insufficiency** for expanded role | Collateral requirements reviewed in Phase 1 before expanding responsibilities |
| **Community resistance** to role consolidation | Phased approach allows course correction; each phase requires governance approval |

---

## Timeline

Phases are sequential. Each phase requires governance approval before proceeding. No fixed calendar dates — progression is gated by completion criteria, not deadlines.
