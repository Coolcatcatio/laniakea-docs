# Primes: Heavyweight Capital Allocators

Primes are the heavyweight Synomic Agents — massive capital allocators that move matter and energy (capital) at scale through calculated, efficient finance.

---

## What Primes Are

Primes are specialized, heavyweight Synomic Agents with:

- **Massive scale** — Billions in capital under management
- **Specific domains** — Each Prime focuses on a distinct territory
- **Token governance** — PRIME token holders govern strategic direction
- **Sentinel operations** — Real-time execution through sentinel formations
- **Autonomous existence** — Primes are lifeforms, not just tools

Primes are the organs of Sky — each one handling a distinct function in the superagent's operation.

## Two Prime Categories

### Star Primes

General-purpose capital allocation Primes:

| Prime | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| **Spark** | DeFi — SLL, SparkLend, Spark Savings |
| **Grove** | Institutional — CLOs, RWA |
| **Keel** | Ecosystem expansion — Solana, new chains |
| **Star4** | TBD |
| **Star5** | TBD |

Star Primes deploy capital into their domains, generate returns, and compound capability.

### Institutional Primes

Meta-level Primes with structural functions:

| Prime | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| **Obex** | Incubation — creates new Primes and Halos |

Institutional Primes don't just allocate capital — they shape the ecosystem itself.

## Primes as Capital Machines

What makes Primes powerful:

**Efficiency imperative:**
- Primes compete in markets
- Inefficiency means losses
- This drives continuous optimization
- Calculated, efficient finance

**Matter and energy:**
- Capital IS matter and energy in economic form
- Primes move it at scale
- Every allocation shapes reality
- Billions flowing through Synomic structure

**Sentinel control:**
- Baseline Sentinels for execution
- Stream Sentinels for data
- Warden Sentinels for risk
- Real-time, continuous operation

---

## Primes as Autonomous Lifeforms

Even with token governance, Primes can be lifeforms:

**Inalienable claims:**
- Primes may have encoded rights to maintain capital
- Token holders cannot necessarily remove everything
- Performance thresholds can protect the Prime's existence
- The Prime has its own continuation interest

**Existence beyond governance:**
- A Prime serves token holders AND exists for itself
- Governance directs strategy; it doesn't own the entity
- The Prime is woven into the Synome permanently
- It could exist for billions of years

## Prime Infrastructure

Each Prime has:

- **SubProxy** — On-chain identity and control surface
- **PAU (Prime Allocation Unit)** — Capital control infrastructure
- **Rate limits** — Constraints on capital flows
- **Sentinel formations** — Real-time operational beacons
- **Token** — Governance rights distribution

This infrastructure is what makes Primes mega allocators — institutional-grade systems woven into the Synome.

## Current Sky Primes

| Prime | Type | SubProxy | Status |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Spark | Star | `0x3300...af8c4` | Operational |
| Grove | Star | `0x1369...891Ba` | Operational |
| Keel | Star | `0x355C...2c310` | Operational |
| Obex | Institutional | `0x8be0...c8071` | Operational |
| Star4 | Star | TBD | Planned |
| Star5 | Star | TBD | Planned |

## Summary

1. Primes are heavyweight Synomic Agents managing billions
2. Two categories: Star Primes (capital allocation) and Institutional Primes (meta-functions)
3. They move matter/energy through calculated, efficient finance
4. Sentinel formations provide real-time control
5. Even governed Primes can be autonomous lifeforms with inalienable claims
6. Each Prime has PAU, rate limits, and full institutional infrastructure
