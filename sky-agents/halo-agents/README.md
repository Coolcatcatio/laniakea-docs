# Halo Agents

Halos are general-purpose Synomic Agents — the fractal layer that proliferates to meet demand. They range from minimal autonomous lifeforms to complex institutional products, organized into Classes (shared infrastructure), Sleeves (asset-side risk isolation), and Units (liability-side investor claims).

Start with [`agent-type-halos.md`](agent-type-halos.md) for the conceptual overview and classification, then [`halo-class-sleeve-unit.md`](halo-class-sleeve-unit.md) for the three-layer architecture.
