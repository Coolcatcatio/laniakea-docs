# Staking Halos

**Status:** Draft concept
**Date:** February 2026

## Overview

A Staking Halo is a personal Halo Agent that any SKY holder can instantly create to participate in Growth Staking. It serves as a self-contained staking and investment vehicle — holding both staked SKY and a portfolio of growth assets inside its PAU (Parallelized Allocation Unit).

Staking Halos are the entry point to the Sky Agent ecosystem. From a Staking Halo, a holder can graduate to operating a Standard Halo or Prime via [Type 1 Restructure](../agent-creation-restructuring/agent-restructuring.md#type-1-restructure).
