# Guardians: Privileged Operation Agents

Guardians are Synomic Agents that perform privileged operations — entities that post collateral and execute critical functions with accountability. Guardians consolidate the former Facilitator (interpretation), Aligned Delegate (governance participation), and Executor (operations) roles into a single collateral-backed role.

## What Guardians Are

Guardians are operational Synomic Agents:

- **Privileged operations** — Can perform actions others cannot
- **Collateral backing** — Post escrow to guarantee performance
- **Slashing risk** — Face penalties for failures
- **Interpretation authority** — Core Guardians interpret Atlas and create binding precedents
- **Governance participation** — Core Guardians receive delegated SKY voting power

Guardians are the stewards of the system — they interpret its constitution, execute its operations, and guard its integrity.

## How Guardians Work

The Guardian model:

```
Guardian
    │
    ├── Posts collateral/escrow
    │
    ├── Receives authority to perform operations
    │
    ├── Interprets Atlas (Core Guardians)
    │
    ├── Executes privileged functions
    │
    └── Faces slashing if failures occur
```

**The accountability loop:**
1. Guardian posts collateral (skin in the game)
2. System grants execution authority
3. Guardian performs operations (and interpretation, if Core)
4. If failure: collateral slashed
5. If success: Guardian earns fees/rewards

## Guardian Types

Different Guardian roles in Sky:

| Guardian Type | Function | Risk |
|---------------|----------|------|
| **Core Guardians** | Interpret Atlas, oversee Operational Guardians, governance participation | Slashing for misinterpretation or misalignment |
| **Operational Guardians** | Perform routine privileged ops | Slashing for failures |

## Guardians vs Other Agents

**Guardians vs Primes:**
- Primes allocate capital; Guardians perform operations
- Primes are strategic; Guardians are operational
- Primes are permanent; Guardians are role-based

**Guardians vs Halos:**
- Halos wrap value; Guardians perform actions
- Halos can be passive; Guardians are active
- Halos proliferate; Guardians are specific roles

**Guardians vs Generators:**
- Generators create credit; Guardians execute operations
- Generators are foundational; Guardians are functional
- Generators are singular; Guardians are multiple per type

## Collateral and Slashing

The Guardian accountability model:

**Collateral:**
- Posted before receiving authority
- Proportional to operation risk
- Locked for duration of role
- Released on successful completion or role exit

**Slashing conditions:**
- Incorrect execution
- Failure to execute
- Delayed execution beyond tolerance
- Malicious behavior
- Bad faith interpretation (Core Guardians)

**Slashing severity:**
- Minor failures: partial slash
- Major failures: significant slash
- Malicious behavior: full slash + exclusion

## Guardian Lifecycle

**Registration:**
- Post required collateral
- Register for Guardian role
- Receive authority envelope
- Begin operations

**Operation:**
- Perform privileged functions
- Interpret Atlas and create precedents (Core Guardians)
- Maintain collateral levels
- Report and attest as required
- Earn execution fees

**Exit:**
- Complete pending operations
- Wait for challenge period
- Reclaim collateral (if no slashing)
- Deregister from role

## Guardians as Synomic Agents

Like all Synomic Agents, Guardians are woven into the Synome:

- **Public accountability** — Actions visible and auditable
- **Constrained authority** — Can only do what role permits
- **Collateral-backed** — Skin in the game ensures alignment
- **Part of the system** — Not external contractors, Synomic entities

Guardians demonstrate that trusted execution can exist in a trustless system — through collateral, slashing, and Synomic integration.

## Summary

1. Guardians perform privileged operations with collateral backing
2. They post escrow and face slashing for failures
3. Core Guardians interpret Atlas and participate in governance; Operational Guardians focus on execution
4. Accountability through skin in the game
5. Distinct from Primes (strategic), Halos (products), Generators (foundational)
6. Woven into the Synome with public accountability
