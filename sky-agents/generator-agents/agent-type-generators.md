# Generators: The Foundational Agents

Generators are the foundational Synomic Agents — the entities that create the medium through which all other Synomic activity flows.

---

## What Generators Are

Generators are unique, protocol-level Synomic Agents:

- **Foundational** — Other agents depend on them
- **Singular** — Not many like Halos; distinct foundational roles
- **Credit creation** — Interface for stablecoin minting
- **System bedrock** — The trunk from which branches grow

Generators are not Primes or Halos — they're a distinct agent type serving the fundamental monetary function.

## The USDS Generator

The primary Generator in Sky:

**Function:**
- Primary interface for USDS creation
- Manages the fundamental credit that backs USDS
- Provides credit lines to Primes
- Maintains system solvency

**Properties:**
- Singular — there is one USDS Generator
- Permanent — exists as long as USDS exists
- Foundational — all other agents depend on it
- Autonomous — operates according to encoded rules

## Credit Flow

The Generator is the source:

```
            Generator
                │
                │ (credit lines)
    ┌───────────┼───────────┐
    ▼           ▼           ▼
  Spark      Grove        Keel
    │           │           │
    ▼           ▼           ▼
  Halos      Halos       Halos
```

**How it works:**
1. Generator creates USDS against collateral/backing
2. Primes receive credit lines from Generator
3. Primes deploy capital into their domains
4. Halos nest under Primes for specific products
5. Returns flow back up the tree

The Generator doesn't allocate capital like Primes. It creates the medium OF capital.

## Generator Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Foundational Agent |
| **Number** | Singular (one per stablecoin) |
| **Function** | Credit creation, system backing |
| **Dependencies** | None — others depend on it |
| **Governance** | Protocol-level (Sky Core) |

## Relationship to Other Agent Types

**Generators vs Primes:**
- Generators create the medium; Primes move it
- Generators are singular; Primes are multiple
- Generators are foundational; Primes are operational

**Generators vs Halos:**
- Generators enable the system; Halos provide products
- Generators don't proliferate; Halos proliferate fractally
- Generators are bedrock; Halos are surface area

**Generators vs Guardians:**
- Generators create credit; Guardians perform operations
- Generators are permanent; Guardians are role-based
- Generators are singular; Guardians are multiple

## The Generator as Lifeform

Like all Synomic Agents, the Generator is woven into the Synome:

- **Permanent existence** — As long as USDS exists
- **Autonomous operation** — Follows encoded rules
- **Part of the Synome** — Not constrained by it, made of it
- **Foundational purpose** — Its existence enables all else

The Generator is the spring from which the river flows. Without it, no capital moves through the system.

## Summary

1. Generators are foundational Synomic Agents — unique, singular, bedrock
2. The USDS Generator creates the medium through which capital flows
3. Primes receive credit lines from the Generator
4. Generators don't allocate capital — they create it
5. Protocol-level governance (Sky Core)
6. Permanent, autonomous, woven into the Synome
