## Agents

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | Autonomous entity operating within Sky's framework |
| **Synomic Agent** | Durable, ledger-native entity that can own assets and make binding commitments; four types: Prime, Halo, Generator, Guardian |
| **Prime** | Capital-deploying agent category; heavyweight. Two subtypes: Star Primes (5) and Institutional Primes (1) |
| **Star Prime** | Standard Prime operating under a Generator; 5 genesis Stars: Spark, Grove, Keel, Star4, Star5 |
| **Institutional Prime** | Prime focused on institutional users with higher compliance requirements and controlled token holder base; example: Obex |
| **Halo** | Lighter operational agent; wraps external value. Organized into Halo Classes containing Halo Units (liability side) and Halo Sleeves (asset side) |
| **Halo Class** | Grouping of Halo Units and Halo Sleeves sharing the same smart contract infrastructure (PAU, beacons) and legal framework (buybox). Three standard class types: Portfolio (LCTS), Term (NFAT), Trading (AMM). Examples: tranched Portfolio Halo (senior/junior sharing one PAU), NFAT Facility (same buybox, varying duration/size) |
| **Portfolio Halo** | Standard Halo Class type using LCTS — pooled capital, fungible shares, queue-based entry/exit, uniform terms |
| **Term Halo** | Standard Halo Class type using NFAT — bespoke deals, non-fungible positions, individual terms within buybox |
| **Trading Halo** | Standard Halo Class type using AMM — programmatic counterparty providing instant liquidity for RWA tokens and ecosystem assets at a spread |

| **Special Halo** | Halo with additional regulatory or operational requirements beyond standard rules: Identity Network Halo, Exchange Halo, Staking Halo |
| **Halo Unit** | Liability side — individual claim within a Halo Class; specific parameters within the class's bounds (e.g., a specific tranche, a specific NFAT). Each unit is a claim on a specific Halo Sleeve |
| **Halo Sleeve** | Asset side — bankruptcy-remote container holding actual assets that back one or more Halo Units. Units sharing a sleeve are pari passu on losses (unless tranched). Multiple assets can be blended in a sleeve for borrower privacy |
| **Ecosystem Accord** | Pre-negotiated agreement specifying individual Halo Unit and Halo Sleeve terms; overrides the general buybox of the Halo Class |
| **Attestor** | Company whitelisted by Sky governance to provide risk attestations about Halo Sleeve contents via `lpha-attest`; bridges borrower privacy with risk transparency |
| **Core Halos** | Legacy assets (Morpho vaults, Aave pools, SparkLend, etc.) standardized as Halo Units under Core Council governance. Primes deploy to Core Halos via CoreHaloFacet. Core Halos can transition to Prime ownership or wind down systematically |
| **Guardian** | Governance operator agent; performs privileged operations with collateral-backed accountability. Consolidates the former Facilitator (interpretation) and Aligned Delegate (governance participation) roles. Two subtypes: Core Guardian (interpretation, oversight, governance) and Operational Guardian (day-to-day execution) |
| **Generator** | Foundational Synomic Agent that interfaces with stablecoin ERC20 contracts and creates the credit medium. Currently one implicit Generator for USDS; future Generators will issue Sky Generated Assets (SGAs) for other currencies |

| **First Loss Capital (FLC)** | The first 10% of JRC losses, absorbed solely by Prime's own capital (IJRC) before external JRC shares losses |
| **Agent Token Inflation** | Loss absorption mechanism (step 3) where Prime token is inflated to cover losses after JRC exhaustion; can theoretically cover unlimited losses |
| **SKY Token Inflation** | Loss absorption mechanism (step 5) where SKY token is inflated to cover losses at protocol level after SRC pool exhaustion |
| **Genesis Capital** | Protocol reserves; loss absorption step 6 — haircut applied only after all risk capital and token inflation mechanisms exhausted |

## Risk Framework

| Term | Definition |

| **Duration Bucket** | Time bucket for duration matching (15 days each, 101 buckets total). Assets require capacity in buckets matching their SPTP; liabilities provide capacity based on Lindy-estimated remaining duration |
| **Duration Model** | Liability-side duration estimation based on the Lindy effect: the longer someone has held, the longer they're likely to continue holding. Structural caps (double exponential decay) limit capacity per bucket based on empirical bank run data. Also called "Lindy Duration Model" |

## Synomics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Synomics** | The unified field studying Sky's autonomous institutional ecosystem — encompasses both system-level architecture and teleonome-level design. Analogous to "economics" as an umbrella discipline |
| **Macrosynomics** | System-level synomics: the Synome as institutional infrastructure — layers, mesh, beacon framework, synomic agents, Atlas/Synome separation, knowledge management. "How do you design a system of institutions that produces good outcomes at scale?" Analogous to macroeconomics. The crypto/economics entry point into synomics |
| **Synoteleonomics** | The study of purposive entities (teleonomes) within the synomic context — their design, economics, purpose, and teleology. "What are these beings, what drives them, what should they become?" Analogous to microeconomics but asymmetric: necessarily contains macrosynomics because every teleonome's dreamer system simulates the entire Synome. The AI/autonomy entry point into synomics |
| **Synodoxics** | The study of knowledge dynamics within the Synome — how knowledge is represented, weighted, queried, secured, and evolved. Covers the probabilistic mesh, truth values, security mechanisms, retrieval policy, and formal language (synlang) |
| **Teleonome** | Private, goal-directed AI system; dark by default — thinks and plans without being observable. Acts in the world only through beacons. Operates Synomic Agents (Primes, Halos, etc.) through High Authority beacons but is a distinct entity: teleonomes are private and mutable; Synomic Agents are public and durable |
| **Accordant** | Entity authorized to operate on behalf of a Synomic Agent. Phase 1: GovOps team holding a cBEAM for a PAU. Phase 9+: sentinel operator holding a pBEAM under a Guardian Accord. Broader usage: any party with a formal operating relationship to an Agent |
| **Carry** | Private profit earned by a teleonome from operating a stream sentinel that outperforms its benchmark; reinvested into proprietary capabilities |
| **The Hearth** | Teleological framework — explicit sacred commitments for the age of AI. The teleological layer of synomics. See `synomics/hearth/` |
| **Hearth Commitments** | Three sacred commitments: (1) Life and Natural Childhood, (2) The Hearth (solar system preserved), (3) Natural Sovereignty. Near-universal values made explicit and immutable |
| **Paraspiritual** | Alongside the spiritual, not itself a religion. The Hearth's self-description: it occupies the territory where genuine commitment is required and pure rationalism runs out, without claiming to be a spiritual tradition or competing with existing ones. The honest acknowledgment that coordinating humanity through AGI requires faith-level commitment — and that this is appropriate to the stakes, not a failure of rigor |

---

## Synome Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Five-Layer Architecture** | The Synome's structural hierarchy: (1) Synome → (2) Synomic Agents → (3) Teleonomes → (4) Embodiment → (5) Embodied Agent. See `synomics/macrosynomics/synome-layers.md` |
| **Dual Architecture** | The Synome's two-network structure: a sparse deontic skeleton (hard, authoritative rules) overlaid with a dense probabilistic mesh (soft, informing connections) |

| **Crystallization Interface** | The governance boundary where probabilistic evidence is deliberated and converted into deontic commitments, or where deontic rules are softened back to probabilistic status for re-evaluation |
| **Synart** | Synomic-level curated knowledge; highest authority in the probabilistic mesh. Governance-vetted, alignment-safe |
| **Telart** | Teleonome-level curated knowledge; mission-specific, derived from synart |
| **Embart** | Embodiment-level curated knowledge; local observations, least vetted but most contextual |
| **Embodiment** | Layer 4 in the five-layer architecture; a specific runtime instance of a teleonome deployed in a particular substrate |
| **Binding** | The process by which a teleonome becomes legible to and accountable within the Synome; prerequisite for accessing Synomic resources |
| **Emergence** | The transition from scripted automation to durable, self-maintaining entity; the process by which a teleonome acquires genuine persistence |

---

## Synome Cognition

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

| **Ema** | Epistemic Module Assembly — coordinated group of emos forming a cognitive subsystem |
| **Synlang** | Formal language for expressing Synome knowledge and operations. S-expression notation is an architectural commitment; structural/scalability design remains exploratory |
| **S-Expression** | The committed notation format for synlang; Lisp-style parenthesized prefix expressions for Synome knowledge representation |
| **Symbolic Gate** | Interface between neural (LLM) processing and symbolic (knowledge graph) processing in the neurosymbolic architecture |
| **Truth Values** | (strength, confidence) pairs that weight claims in the probabilistic mesh; range from speculative (low confidence) to axiomatic (1,1). The evidence-counting method for deriving truth values is the one epistemological axiom |
| **Dreamer** | The simulation/exploration component of a teleonome; evolves strategies in sandboxed environments without real-world risk |
| **Actuator** | The real-world interaction component of a teleonome; deploys strategies, collects evidence, makes decisions under uncertainty |

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cancer-Logic** | Self-referential corruption pattern where knowledge modifications change the criteria for evaluating modifications; the primary security threat to the probabilistic mesh |
| **Ossification** | The spectrum from speculative to axiomatic knowledge; high-ossification patterns resist change proportionally to accumulated evidence. A specific mechanism within synomic inertia |
| **Synomic Inertia** | The system's resistance to change proportional to evidence behind its current state; naturally throttles RSI (edge patterns evolve rapidly, core patterns slowly). Umbrella concept encompassing ossification |
| **Wild Synome** | Unauthorized or unverified knowledge graph operating outside Synomic governance; a rogue risk vector |

---

## The Hearth

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
