# Smart Contracts

On-chain contract architecture for Laniakea's capital deployment infrastructure. The core design principle is the PAU (Parallelized Allocation Unit) pattern — Controller + ALMProxy + RateLimits — reused identically across all four layers (Generator, Prime, Halo, Foreign). Layers differ only in configuration, not in contract code.

Start with [`architecture-overview.md`](architecture-overview.md) for the four-layer architecture, capital flow diagrams, and the PAU pattern.
