# Synodoxics TODO

## Terminology Consistency

- [ ] **Fix "synomic inertia" usage across synodoxics and sibling directories.** `security-and-resources.md` introduces synomic inertia as the broader concept subsuming ossification, but other docs (`probabilistic-mesh.md`, `synome-overview.md`, synoteleonomics summary) use "ossification" as if it's the broader concept. Either propagate the inertia framing to the other docs or collapse the distinction.

## Cross-Boundary Reference Maintenance

When editing synodoxics docs that reference macrosynomics concepts (5-layer architecture, agents, beacons, governance), maintain Tier 2 references: 1-2 sentence definitions + links to the canonical macrosynomics doc. Enough to follow the document standalone, but not re-explanations.
