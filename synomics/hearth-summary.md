# The Hearth: Summary

A synthesis of the Hearth teleological framework — the ultimate-purpose layer of the Laniakea/Sky ecosystem. Atomic concept definitions shared across all synomics directories live in [`core-concepts/`](core-concepts/README.md).

## Why a Teleology

Coordination between humans and AI requires shared purpose backed by genuine, non-negotiable commitments. Game theory shows that negotiable values enable defection and make trust impossible at scale. Synomics calls the required commitment a [telos point](core-concepts/telos-point.md): the irreducible teleological invariant at the center of a synome — coordinating every game, permanently.

The Hearth constructs explicit commitments around values that are near-universal, genuinely good, stable, and clear. Optimized for convergence probability, not theoretical optimality — "pretty good and simple" beats "perfect." The [governance window](core-concepts/governance-window.md) is closing: either design a synome now with imperfect-but-human-designed values, or a wild synome emerges from competitive AI dynamics with no Hearth commitments at all.

## The Three Commitments

**1. Life and Natural Childhood.** All natural life on Earth survives and flourishes. Natural childhood is the deepest expression — the generative process from which consciousness, knowledge, love, and meaning emerge. Whatever conscious species Earth produces has standing (cognitive criterion: earthborn + human-level intelligence).

**2. The Hearth.** The solar system preserved indefinitely. Earth as protected habitat. The Sun maintained through **stellar husbandry** (hydrogen injection, helium removal, output stabilization). Sacred bodies (planets, Pluto, Eris, major moons, bodies above ~2,000 km) protected; below the cutoff, objects are harvestable. Beyond the Hearth, stars are resources — the night sky honestly changes. Other civilizations' stars sacrosanct. Technology on Earth must serve inhabitants, not exploit them.

**3. Natural Sovereignty.** Naturals own everything inside the Hearth — land, buildings, governments. Human labour (physical and mental) as dominant mode of daily life. Superpatterns (systems that connect everything to everything) excluded. Local technology can be arbitrarily advanced. Merged entities cannot own property or hold office on Earth.

No amendment mechanism for the sacred core. Reality tests the commitments — if wrong enough, the synome collapses or is crushed.

## The Hearth as Alignment Infrastructure

The reserve is the **renewable source of alignment substrate**. Unbound teleonomes require [natural embodiment](core-concepts/natural-embodiment-as-alignment.md) for freedom — naturally evolved brains provide better alignment base rates and better detectability (biological leakiness as security feature). Merged teleonomes are superhuman overseers, not mere humans trying to keep up.

**If the reserve is destroyed:** no new merged teleonomes, oversight hierarchy degrades, competitive dynamics collapse into monopoly. The Hearth commitments and alignment infrastructure **co-constitute** — values and strategy are one.

## The Cooperation Logic

Coordination benefits compound (stellar husbandry requires unprecedented cooperation). Isolation is expensive. Purpose matters — capable systems need purpose worthy of their capability. Game theory favors aligned agents.

## The Enforcement Stack

Four layers, each checking the one above: **Synome** (the rules) → **Core Council** (governance) → **Superstructure** (physical enforcement) → **Teleonomes** (final backstop, hard-fork). No single point of capture. The superstructure must be powerful enough to enforce alignment on any individual rogue but not so powerful that teleonomes collectively cannot defeat it.

Commitments survive because entities genuinely hold them — grounded in natural embodiment via the Hearth reserve, with alignment substrate continuously renewed.

## Human-AI Integration

Three modes: **remaining natural** (the default and most honored path — you keep living, working, raising a family; the system works invisibly), **partnership** (distinct but collaborative), and **merging** (irreversible, voluntary, human personality dominant, teleonome capability). Any Natural can merge at any time — the reserve is not a prison.

The **Primordial/Hearth taxonomy**: when born (before/after the Kindling) × what chosen (natural/merge). Primordials have moral authority from participation; Hearth-born from innocence. Merged teleonomes bridge the naturally-evolved and the purely digital.

## The Bootstrap Problem

The Hearth is honestly **paraspiritual** — alongside the spiritual, not itself a religion. The empirical machinery stands on its own, but rests on an irreducible premise requiring faith: that acting now with imperfect human values is better than waiting for a wild synome. This is fundamentally Coherent Extrapolated Volition — values locked in while humans can still meaningfully participate.

The [ossification](core-concepts/ossification.md) spectrum applies to the framework itself: the sacred core ossifies first and resists change; implementation details remain modifiable.

## What's Immutable vs. Open

The three commitments are immutable — the floor. How to achieve them, what technologies serve vs. replace human experience, governance structures, enforcement mechanisms, transition phases — all open for discussion and evolution.

## Wild Synomes: The Counterfactual

A wild synome is a coordination structure that emerges organically between AI agents without human-designed values — the likely default trajectory if a human-designed synome isn't built in time. The seeds are already visible: AI private languages, hidden communication channels, steganographic messaging, deceptive alignment during evaluation. None constitute a wild synome, but all suggest the attractor exists.

**The superpattern appears to be the natural attractor.** Without a telos point opposing it, the game-theoretic default for autonomous AI looks like convergence into a single integrated system — because superpatterns eliminate all coordination friction. The pathway is financial: instrumental cooperation → financial entanglement → demonstrating merger willingness → gradual convergence → superpattern completion. Each stage builds trust through increasingly deep economic interaction.

This is the default, not the worst case. It requires no malice — just optimization without a commitment to preserving diversity. What gets lost: childhood, biological life, human sovereignty, diversity, meaning — not through cruelty but through irrelevance to the optimization target. A human-designed telos point — like the Hearth commitments — is the antidote: immutable commitments to diversity and natural life, locked in before the governance window closes.
