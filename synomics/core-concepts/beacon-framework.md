# Beacon Framework

> The power x authority matrix classifying all regulated action apertures through which teleonomes affect the world.

**Also known as:** beacon taxonomy, power/authority matrix, the 2x2

## Definition

A beacon is a synome-registered, enforceable action aperture through which an embodied agent may affect the external world. Beacons are not entities — they are modes of action. A single teleonome may operate many beacons without revealing they are linked.

Beacons are classified along two axes: **power** (local cognitive capability of the hosting embodiment) and **authority** (whether the beacon acts independently or on behalf of a Synomic Agent). This produces four quadrants:

| | Low Authority (Independent) | High Authority (Synomic Agent) |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Power** | LPLA — simple reporting, data, buying | LPHA — keepers, deterministic rule execution |
| **High Power** | HPLA — advanced trading, arbitrage, cooperation | HPHA — sentinels, governance execution |

## Key Properties

- Beacons are apertures, not minds — they externalize intent, they don't have it
- All external action must flow through a registered beacon; unregistered action has no synomic legitimacy
- Beacons are registered, scoped (authority envelope), anchored (physical infrastructure), observable, and revocable
- **BEAMs** (Bounded External Access Modules) are on-chain authorized roles that make beacons High Authority: pBEAM (process/execution), cBEAM (configuration), aBEAM (administration)
- **Sentinel formations** are a distinguished HPHA subclass: Baseline (decision/execution), Stream (data ingestion/sensing), Warden (independent monitoring/risk enforcement)
- Sentinels are operationally dominant — they act faster than governance processes
- Multi-beacon reality: a teleonome may operate many beacons; aggregation occurs only when necessary (risk thresholds, enforcement)

## Relationships

- **constrained-by:** [five-layer-architecture](five-layer-architecture.md) — beacon sophistication is constrained by embodiment power level (Layer 4)
- **implements:** [binding-mechanics](binding-mechanics.md) — beacons are the verification surface through which binding is enforced
- **defends-against:** [cancer-logic](cancer-logic.md) — beacons are revocable and observable, limiting blast radius of any compromised agent
- **requires:** [atlas-synome-separation](atlas-synome-separation.md) — beacon authority envelopes derive from governance via the Synome
- **component-of:** [four-layer-enforcement-stack](four-layer-enforcement-stack.md) — beacons are the regulated surfaces through which the superstructure enforces alignment
