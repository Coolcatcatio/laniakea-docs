# Dual Architecture

> The Synome operates through two fundamentally different types of structure simultaneously: a sparse deontic skeleton (hard rules) and a dense probabilistic mesh (soft knowledge).

**Also known as:** probabilistic-deontic architecture, two networks

## Definition

The Synome is a probabilistic-deontic architecture with two complementary types of connections operating simultaneously. The **deontic skeleton** is sparse, load-bearing, and deterministic — axioms that must be followed, governance decisions, authority hierarchies, enforcement mechanisms. The **probabilistic mesh** is dense, informing, and adaptive — knowledge with truth values, evidence flowing from the world, patterns that ossify over time, recursive self-improvement.

The skeleton is what gets drawn in architecture diagrams. The mesh is too dense to draw — essentially "everything can potentially inform everything else" within access constraints. The system can't function if everything is probabilistic (you need hard rules) or everything is deontic (you need learning). Both must coexist.

## Key Properties

- Deontic connections: hard, deterministic, authoritative, hierarchical, require governance to change
- Probabilistic connections: soft, weighted, informing, non-hierarchical, constantly flowing and learning
- Governance sits at the interface — consuming probabilistic evidence, producing deontic commitments
- The **deontic skeleton** includes: the Synomic Library's deontic components (Atlas, Axioms, Language Intent) and all institutional/enforcement mechanisms
- Once a decision crystallizes from probabilistic evidence into a deontic rule, it holds unconditionally
- The two are endpoints of a spectrum, not separate systems — unannotated knowledge is (1,1), the skeleton is the maximally-ossified mesh
- Visual convention: solid arrows for hard connections, dashed arrows for soft connections

## Relationships

- **contains:** [probabilistic-mesh](probabilistic-mesh.md) — the mesh is one half of the dual architecture
- **implements:** [five-layer-architecture](five-layer-architecture.md) — both skeleton and mesh permeate all five layers
- **enables:** [crystallization-interface](crystallization-interface.md) — governance crystallizes probabilistic evidence into deontic commitments
