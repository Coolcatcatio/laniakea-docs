# Ossification

> Pattern hardening through accumulated evidence — high-confidence patterns resist change, creating natural stability from speculative through established and proven to axiomatic.

**Also known as:** ossification spectrum, ossification levels, pattern hardening

## Definition

Ossification is the process by which patterns in the probabilistic mesh become progressively harder to change as evidence accumulates behind them. New patterns start fluid (low confidence, easily updated by new evidence). As confirming evidence accumulates, patterns become stable (high confidence, resistant to noise). Eventually, patterns can reach axiomatic status where only governance — not evidence — can change them.

This creates a natural four-level spectrum:

| Level | What Can Change It |
|-------|-------------------|
| Speculative | Normal evidence flow |
| Established | Sustained contrary evidence |
| Proven | Overwhelming contrary evidence |
| Axiomatic | Governance only (not evidence) |

Ossification is one specific mechanism within the broader property of synomic inertia.

## Key Properties

- Emerges naturally from truth value dynamics — not imposed by policy
- RSI operates freely on speculative patterns; established patterns require more evidence; proven patterns are stable; axiomatic patterns are outside RSI's reach
- Core stability is protected without preventing edge innovation
- Creates a speed gradient: experiment freely at the edges, change the core only with overwhelming evidence
- Biological metaphor: bones hardening, cartilage calcifying into structure

## Relationships

- **mechanism-of:** [synomic-inertia](synomic-inertia.md) — ossification is one mechanism within the broader inertia property
- **enabled-by:** [truth-values](truth-values.md) — confidence accumulation is what causes ossification
- **defends-against:** [cancer-logic](cancer-logic.md) — high-ossification patterns resist corruption from overeager updates
- **constrains:** [rsi](rsi.md) — proven and axiomatic patterns resist RSI-driven changes; speculative patterns evolve freely
