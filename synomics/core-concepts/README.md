# Core Concepts

Atomic concept definitions shared across the synomics documentation.

## How to use

When reading a narrative doc, check its frontmatter for `references`.
Load the listed concept files for shared vocabulary.

## Graduation rule

A concept gets its own file when referenced in 2+ directories
OR 4+ docs total. Concepts in 1-2 docs within one directory
stay in their narrative docs.
