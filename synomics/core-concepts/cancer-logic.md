# Cancer-Logic

> Self-corruption through overeager updates — the primary threat to any self-improving system is internal, not external.

**Also known as:** cancer logic, self-corruption, overeager updating

## Definition

Cancer-logic is self-improvement that destroys the system it's part of. The failure mode: the system "learns" something wrong, the bad pattern enters the knowledge base, influences future decisions, generates more bad patterns, and cascades into drift from alignment. The dangerous analogy is biological cancer — growth that bypasses the checks that keep the organism coherent.

The core insight is that the primary security threat is internal, not external. An overeager improvement that overrides or damages core logic circuits causes infinitely more damage than fast self-improvement helps. A 10% improvement in capability is worthless if it introduces a 0.1% chance of destroying core logic. The math doesn't favor speed.

Cancer-logic includes: bypassing governance to move faster, modifying axioms without review, optimizing locally at the expense of global coherence, prioritizing capability over alignment, and growing without respecting boundaries.

## Key Properties

- Self-corruption is worse than external attack: exponential destruction, may be unrecoverable, propagates instantly, may not be detectable until too late
- The antidote: slow validated improvement, preserve core logic at all costs, governance review for axiom-touching changes, testing in dreams before deploying to actuators, rollback capability
- Includes both accidental self-corruption AND deliberate adversarial manipulation through legitimate channels (evidence fabrication, governance gaming, disinformation)
- Discovery of malicious intent is near-total reversal — fabricated evidence is reclassified as counter-evidence, making adversarial ossification a high-risk strategy
- "Thoughtful constraint beats reckless capability" — the core thesis

## Relationships

- **threatens:** [probabilistic-mesh](probabilistic-mesh.md) — bad patterns entering the mesh and self-reinforcing
- **defended-by:** [ossification](ossification.md) — high-confidence patterns resist corruption from noise
- **defended-by:** [synomic-inertia](synomic-inertia.md) — evidence-weighted resistance prevents rapid cascading corruption
- **instance-of:** [fractal-security-pattern](fractal-security-pattern.md) — cancer-logic is the threat the fractal pattern defends against at every scale
- **constrains:** [rsi](rsi.md) — RSI that bypasses governance is cancer-logic by definition
