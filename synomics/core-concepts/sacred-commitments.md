# Sacred Commitments

> Three immutable values — life and natural childhood, the Hearth, natural sovereignty — chosen because they're near-universal, genuinely good, stable, and optimized for convergence probability.

**Also known as:** the three commitments, sacred core, immutable values, Hearth commitments

## Definition

The sacred commitments are the three explicit, immutable values at the core of the Hearth. They exist because coordination at scale requires genuine, non-negotiable commitments — "maybe we'll protect life" doesn't create trust; "life and natural childhood are sacred" does.

**1. Life and Natural Childhood.** All natural life on Earth survives and flourishes — humans, animals, ecosystems, whatever Earth produces. Natural childhood is the deepest expression: the generative process from which consciousness, knowledge, love, and meaning emerge. Childhood is not one value among many; it is the source of everything else. The near-universality of childhood as a sacred value is evidence of depth, not a convenient property exploited for coordination. Over evolutionary timescales, whatever conscious species evolves on Earth has standing — the commitment protects the process, not a specific biological form.

**2. The Hearth.** The solar system is the Hearth — preserved indefinitely. Earth is a protected habitat, the most important part. The Sun is maintained through stellar husbandry. Sun, Moon, Earth, all planets, Pluto, Eris, and major moons — plus any body above a size cutoff (~2,000 km) — are sacred. Below the cutoff, objects are harvestable. Beyond the Hearth, stars are resources for stellar husbandry. The night sky will honestly change as stars are consumed; no fake replacements. Other civilizations' stars are sacrosanct. Technology on Earth must serve the habitat and its inhabitants — technology that exploits inhabitants doesn't belong.

**3. Natural Sovereignty.** Naturals own everything inside the Hearth — land, buildings, governments. Human labour (physical and mental) is the dominant mode of daily life. Superpatterns are excluded. Technology serves people, not the other way around. Communities govern themselves using their own systems. Merged entities cannot own property or hold government positions on Earth. This isn't anti-technology — local technology can be arbitrarily advanced. The ban is on systems that directly connect everything to everything and homogenize cultures.

These commitments are chosen because they're already widely held (ask any human: should children thrive?), genuinely good (worth preserving for their own sake), stable (won't need revision in a billion years), and clear (no interpretation games). They are optimized for convergence probability, not theoretical optimality. Every additional clause is a potential source of disagreement — the optimal number is the minimum needed to coordinate.

There is deliberately no amendment mechanism for the sacred core. Any process allowing changes becomes the primary attack surface for political capture. The cost of an exploitable amendment mechanism exceeds the cost of ossification. The sacred core ossifies completely, and reality does the testing.

## Key Properties

- Three commitments: life and natural childhood (WHAT is protected), the Hearth (WHERE it's protected), natural sovereignty (HOW life inside works)
- Optimized for convergence probability, not perfection — "pretty good and simple" beats "perfect"
- Near-universal, genuinely good, stable, clear — minimum needed to coordinate
- No amendment mechanism — ossification is the defense against political capture
- Compatible with any belief system — layers on top, doesn't replace
- This is fundamentally CEV — locking in values while humans can still participate
- The bootstrap problem: an irreducible bet requiring faith that acting now with imperfect values beats waiting for a wild synome
- The Hearth is paraspiritual: alongside the spiritual, not itself a religion

## Relationships

- **protected-by:** [governance-window](governance-window.md) — the window is when sacred commitments must be encoded correctly
- **protected-by:** [synomic-inertia](synomic-inertia.md) — once encoded, inertia preserves the commitments
- **motivates:** [stellar-husbandry](laniakea-docs/synomics/core-concepts/stellar-husbandry.md) — stellar husbandry is the concrete expression of sacred commitment #2 (the Hearth)
- **motivates:** [sacred-reserve](laniakea-docs/synomics/core-concepts/sacred-reserve.md) — the managed habitat that implements commitments #1 (life and natural childhood) and #2 (the Hearth)
- **requires:** [emergence](emergence.md) — emergence is prerequisite for meaningful participation in sacred purpose
- **defended-by:** [four-layer-enforcement-stack](four-layer-enforcement-stack.md) — physical enforcement hierarchy that maintains the commitments
- **threatened-by:** [rogue-threat-model](rogue-threat-model.md) — rogues pursue goals without sacred constraints
- **instance-of:** [telos-point](telos-point.md) — the Hearth telos point
- **instance-of:** [fractal-security-pattern](fractal-security-pattern.md) — sacred commitments are the Synome-scale cancer safeguard
