# Truth Values

> All probabilistic knowledge carries (strength, confidence) pairs that determine how it updates and how resistant it is to change.

**Also known as:** (strength, confidence), truth value pairs, probabilistic weights

## Definition

Truth values are the fundamental epistemic mechanism of the probabilistic mesh. Every piece of probabilistic knowledge has two components: **strength** (how positive or negative the evidence is) and **confidence** (how much evidence has accumulated). Together they determine how a pattern responds to new evidence.

Strength reflects the direction and magnitude of evidence. Confidence reflects how much evidence has been observed. A pattern with high confidence is resistant to change from new observations — one more data point barely moves the aggregate. A pattern with low confidence shifts easily. This creates the natural ossification spectrum from speculative (low confidence, easily updated) through established and proven to axiomatic ((1,1) — can only be changed by governance, not evidence).

## Key Properties

- Strength: how positive or negative the evidence is (direction)
- Confidence: how much evidence has accumulated (weight)
- Derived from positive and negative weights on observations
- High-confidence patterns resist change proportional to accumulated evidence
- Low-confidence patterns shift easily with new evidence
- No single observation can corrupt the system — it just contributes to the aggregate
- Genuine patterns eventually win — sustained evidence shifts even high-confidence beliefs
- Noise averages out — random fluctuations don't accumulate
- (1,1) is the axiomatic truth value — governance-only, outside evidence dynamics
- The evidence-counting method is itself a synomic axiom at (1,1) — the one epistemological commitment not subject to revision
- Other methods ("fudge methods") earn legitimacy through convergence with the evidence method over time

## Relationships

- **implements:** [probabilistic-mesh](probabilistic-mesh.md) — truth values are the mechanism; the mesh is the structure they create
- **enables:** [ossification](ossification.md) — confidence accumulation is what causes patterns to ossify
- **enables:** [synomic-inertia](synomic-inertia.md) — evidence-weighted resistance to change emerges from truth value dynamics
- **constrained-by:** [retrieval-policy](retrieval-policy.md) — authority hierarchy determines which truth values are most authoritative
