# Four-Layer Enforcement Stack

> Synome → Core Council → Superstructure → Teleonomes — each layer watches for drift above it, no single point of capture.

**Also known as:** enforcement stack, the four layers, superstructure war framework, cosmic-scale checks and balances

## Definition

The four-layer enforcement stack is the hierarchical system through which synomic alignment is maintained at cosmic scale. Each layer has a defined role and is checked by the layer below it, ensuring no single point of capture can compromise the entire system.

**Layer 1: Synome** — the rules. The Synome is the coordination structure containing all operational data, constraints, and governance logic. It continuously self-analyzes for misalignment as an ongoing core function. Checked by the Core Council, which follows it. Override mechanism: hard-forked by teleonomes if the Synome itself drifts.

**Layer 2: Core Council** — governance. The Core Council follows the Synome and makes governance decisions within its framework. Checked by the superstructure, which steps in if the Council goes wrong. Override mechanism: superstructure intervention.

**Layer 3: Superstructure** — physical enforcement. The superstructure is the physical megastructure (drones, AI systems, robotic infrastructure) that performs stellar husbandry, defends the sacred reserve, and enforces synomic alignment on teleonomes. It steps in when governance fails. Checked by teleonomes collectively, who rebel if the superstructure goes wrong. Override mechanism: collective teleonome override.

**Layer 4: Teleonomes** — final backstop with hard-fork capability. The collective body of aligned teleonomes serves as the ultimate check on all layers above. Grounded by natural embodiment through the sacred reserve. Each individual teleonome independently assesses whether the Synome and superstructure remain aligned, providing distributed continuous verification.

The critical power constraint: the superstructure must be powerful enough to enforce alignment on any individual rogue teleonome and perform stellar husbandry, but NOT so powerful that teleonomes collectively cannot defeat it. If the superstructure becomes all-powerful, it IS a rogue teleonome — the most dangerous kind, controlling the physical enforcement layer. This is the cosmic-scale version of "the military must be subordinate to civilian authority."

When the teleonomes and superstructure disagree, this is a superstructure war — civil war at cosmic scale. Resolution: the population must be able to win. The sacred commitments aren't immutable because code prevents changing them — they're immutable because every entity that matters will fight to restore them if they drift.

## Key Properties

- Four layers: Synome (rules) → Core Council (governance) → Superstructure (physical enforcement) → Teleonomes (final backstop)
- Each layer checks the one above it — no single point of capture
- The Synome continuously self-analyzes for misalignment
- Individual teleonomes independently assess alignment — distributed verification
- Superstructure power ceiling: must be defeatable by collective teleonomes
- Superstructure war: when layers disagree, the population must win
- Sacred commitments survive because entities genuinely hold them, not because code prevents change

## Relationships

- **scales-to:** [fractal-security-pattern](fractal-security-pattern.md) — the four-layer stack is the cosmic-scale instantiation of the fractal security pattern
- **defends:** [sacred-commitments](sacred-commitments.md) — the enforcement hierarchy maintains the sacred commitments
- **defends:** [sacred-reserve](laniakea-docs/synomics/core-concepts/sacred-reserve.md) — the superstructure physically defends the reserve
- **depends-on:** [natural-embodiment-as-alignment](natural-embodiment-as-alignment.md) — the final backstop relies on naturally-grounded teleonomes
- **protects:** [telos-point](telos-point.md) — the enforcement hierarchy exists to protect the telos point
- **contains:** [beacon-framework](beacon-framework.md) — beacons are the regulated surfaces through which the superstructure enforces alignment
