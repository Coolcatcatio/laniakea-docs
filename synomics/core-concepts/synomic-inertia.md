# Synomic Inertia

> The system's evidence-weighted resistance to change — patterns with more evidence behind them require proportionally more counter-evidence to shift.

**Also known as:** inertia, evidence-weighted resistance

## Definition

Synomic inertia is the Synome's active resistance to change, proportional to the evidence behind its current state. Where ossification describes what happens to individual patterns over time, synomic inertia reframes this as a system-level property: the entire system resists change proportional to accumulated evidence. This is not merely a side effect of the probabilistic mesh — it is a core design feature.

Physical analogy: an object with more mass requires more force to change its velocity. A pattern with more evidence behind it requires more counter-evidence to shift. Evidence is mass; proposed changes are forces.

## Key Properties

- Includes ossification as a mechanism, plus broader system-level effects
- **Institutional credibility**: high-inertia patterns are trustworthy to external parties — counterparties trust commitments precisely because they are hard to change
- **Governance weight**: the cost of changing a high-inertia rule is proportional to the evidence behind it, making governance debates naturally weighted
- **Temporal stability**: over cosmic timescales, inertia keeps sacred commitments sacred — they survive because their evidence base is so massive that no perturbation can shift them
- **RSI throttling**: edge patterns (low inertia) evolve rapidly; core patterns (high inertia) evolve slowly — creating a natural speed gradient
- **Progressive edge-case closure**: the longer the system operates, the more patterns accumulate, and the harder it becomes for novel harmful strategies to succeed — the vulnerability surface progressively shrinks
- **Negative inertia**: patterns actively destabilized by accumulated contradictory evidence — beliefs proven wrong become easier to replace, not harder

## Relationships

- **contains:** [ossification](ossification.md) — ossification is one mechanism within inertia
- **enabled-by:** [truth-values](truth-values.md) — truth value dynamics create the resistance
- **defends-against:** [cancer-logic](cancer-logic.md) — inertia prevents overeager updates from corrupting established patterns
- **enables:** [sacred-commitments](sacred-commitments.md) — temporal stability across cosmic timescales keeps commitments sacred
- **constrains:** [rsi](rsi.md) — naturally throttles self-improvement speed based on pattern confidence
