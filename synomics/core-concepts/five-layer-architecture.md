# Five-Layer Architecture

> The Synome's structural model: five layers from shared public truth down to individual execution.

**Also known as:** 5-layer architecture, the layers, layer model

## Definition

The Synome architecture consists of five layers with clear containment boundaries. Layers 1-2 are public and shared across all aligned entities. Layers 3-5 are private to each teleonome. The layers move from abstract shared truth (Layer 1: Synome) down to concrete isolated execution (Layer 5: Embodied Agent).

The five layers are:

1. **Synome** — Public constitution: Atlas, axioms, Synomic Library, Language Intent
2. **Synomic Agents** — Institutional shells: Primes, Halos, Generator, Guardian
3. **Teleonomes** — Autonomous AI entities with directives and missions
4. **Embodiment** — Physical infrastructure hosting teleonome slices
5. **Embodied Agent** — Execution threads operating beacons and hardware

## Key Properties

- Layers 1-2 are public and shared; layers 3-5 are private
- Each layer has a human-readable directive translated by Language Intent (Atlas, Agent Directive, Teleonome Directive)
- Embodiments range in power: light (minimal compute, policy execution), medium (continuous sensing, local intelligence), heavy (deep cognition, dreaming, RSI)
- All enforcement bottoms out in embodiments (Layer 4) — physical infrastructure is the ultimate enforcement boundary
- Intelligence lives privately; power enters the world only through regulated apertures (beacons, Layer 5)

## Relationships

- **contains:** [artifact-hierarchy](artifact-hierarchy.md) — the layers define the artifact boundaries (synart, telart, embart)
- **implements:** [dual-architecture](dual-architecture.md) — the layers carry both deontic skeleton and probabilistic mesh
- **constrains:** [beacon-framework](beacon-framework.md) — beacon sophistication is constrained by embodiment power level
- **requires:** [language-intent](language-intent.md) — every layer's human directive passes through Language Intent
