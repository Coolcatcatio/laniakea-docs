# Governance Window

> The current period while humans can still read the Atlas, understand its implications, and verify it reflects their values — fundamentally CEV.

**Also known as:** the window, CEV window, critical governance period

## Definition

The governance window is the current period during which humans can still meaningfully participate in shaping the system's values. As AI systems become more capable, human governance transitions through distinct regimes: meaningful participation (now), informed oversight, ceremonial governance, and finally beneficiary status. The transitions between these regimes are where course correction becomes difficult and then effectively impossible.

This is fundamentally Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV): lock in values now while humans can still participate, because after a certain capability threshold humans won't be able to correct course. The Atlas is the vessel for these values. What diminishes is not the ability to vote, but the ability to evaluate what you're voting on.

## Key Properties

- Four governance regimes: (1) meaningful participation → (2) informed oversight → (3) ceremonial governance → (4) beneficiary status
- The 1→2 transition is where course correction becomes difficult; 2→3 is where it becomes effectively impossible
- We are currently in regime (1) — every governance cycle spent here is irreplaceable
- Even now, governance is not naive human judgment — it's capital-weighted decisions by token holders (teleonomes, synomic agents, and humans) through structured processes
- What makes the current window special is not that humans are the only decision-makers, but that they can still meaningfully read the Atlas, understand implications, and verify values
- The system eventually becomes "the adult maintaining the habitat" — it must carry coherent values inherited from the window period
- This directly motivates the Atlas/Synome split: distill the Atlas to constitutional essence while humans can still read and govern it
- "The seed determines everything, the seed is being planted now" — a bad axiom at (1,1) confidence is the one thing the architecture cannot self-correct

## Relationships

- **motivated-by:** [atlas-synome-separation](atlas-synome-separation.md) — the separation exists partly to keep the Atlas readable during the window
- **motivates:** [sacred-commitments](sacred-commitments.md) — the window is when sacred commitments must be encoded correctly
- **depends-on:** [crystallization-interface](crystallization-interface.md) — the window is about human participation at the crystallization interface
- **protected-by:** [synomic-inertia](synomic-inertia.md) — once encoded during the window, inertia preserves the values
