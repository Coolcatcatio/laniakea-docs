# Crystallization Interface

> Where governance sits: consuming probabilistic evidence and producing deontic commitments — the bridge between soft knowledge and hard rules.

**Also known as:** governance interface, crystallization dynamic, the bridge

## Definition

The crystallization interface is the point where governance converts probabilistic evidence into deontic commitments. The probabilistic mesh continuously produces evidence, patterns, and recommendations. Governance deliberates, weighs evidence, and makes decisions. Once crystallized, decisions become clean deontic rules with (1,1) truth values — the system couldn't function otherwise.

The flow is one-directional at the moment of crystallization: probabilistic evidence flows in, deontic rules flow out. But the cycle continues — deontic rules constrain action, action produces outcomes, outcomes flow back as probabilistic evidence, informing the next governance decision.

## Key Properties

- Governance consumes probabilistic evidence and produces deontic commitments
- Once crystallized, a decision is hard, deterministic, and must be followed
- Governance sits at every level: Sky Voters (Atlas), Core Council (Layer 1-2), token holders (Agent Directives), bound humans (Teleonome Directives)
- The crystallization moment is where "evidence accumulates → governance deliberates → decision is made → rule is set (1,1)"
- Not all governance is human — as the system matures, governance entities include teleonomes and synomic agents

## Relationships

- **enabled-by:** [dual-architecture](dual-architecture.md) — crystallization is the interface between the two architectural halves
- **consumes:** [probabilistic-mesh](probabilistic-mesh.md) — evidence and patterns from the mesh inform governance
- **produces:** [ossification](ossification.md) — crystallized decisions become axiomatic (1,1) patterns
- **motivates:** [governance-window](governance-window.md) — the urgency of human participation at the crystallization interface while humans can still evaluate
