# Sacred Reserve

> The solar system as a managed habitat — like Yellowstone, not pristine wilderness — where the superstructure is the park service maintaining conditions for natural human life.

**Also known as:** the reserve, managed habitat, solar system reserve

## Definition

The sacred reserve is the solar system classified and managed as a protected habitat for natural human life. It is not pristine wilderness — it is actively managed like Yellowstone, with the superstructure serving as the park service. Intervention is expected, designed for, and necessary.

The reserve classifies bodies by visibility and size. The sacred core (Sun, Moon, Earth) is the irreducible foundation of human existence. Sacred bodies include all planets, Pluto, Eris, and their major moons, plus any body above a size cutoff (~2,000 km diameter). These are "cool objects in the reserve" — significant enough to be worth protecting for their own sake. Below the cutoff, objects (asteroids, small KBOs, comets, Oort Cloud objects) are permanently harvestable resources. Beyond the reserve, other stars and interstellar material are resources for stellar husbandry.

The reserve operates under custodial ethics. Natural humans in the post-singularity world are cognitively outclassed the way animals are outclassed by humans. The ethics are custodial — the same category as humans managing nature reserves. The superstructure designs and manages the reserve for inhabitants' benefit. Inhabitants' preferences matter as inputs (like a good zookeeper attends to animal welfare) but not as authority. The superstructure sometimes overrides preferences for inhabitants' own good (weapon prevention, child protection). This is not livestock ethics — the reserve exists for the inhabitants' benefit, not the custodian's.

The reserve breathes. Earth's value is intrinsic and population-independent. If every human merges, Earth remains sacred — natural evolution continues, complex brains keep developing, the alignment substrate factory keeps running. The commitment is to the possibility: "it must always be possible for a child to grow up naturally on Earth." Primordial Merged can always return through ground-time mechanisms.

The reserve is also alignment infrastructure — the renewable source of naturally-embodied alignment substrate. Natural brains provide better alignment base rates (billions of years of social selection) and better detectability (biological leakiness as a security feature). Destroying the reserve makes alignment substrate non-renewable, oversight hierarchy degrades, and competitive dynamics collapse into monopoly. The sacred commitments ARE the alignment strategy.

The transition occurs in phases: bootstrap (industrial use of sacred bodies permitted temporarily), self-sustaining (superstructure transitions to extrasolar resources), restoration (sacred bodies restored to natural state), and steady state (indefinite maintenance).

## Key Properties

- Managed habitat, not pristine wilderness — the superstructure is the park service
- Custodial ethics: designed for inhabitants' benefit, managed by cognitively superior entities
- The reserve breathes: Earth's value is population-independent
- Alignment infrastructure: renewable source of naturally-embodied alignment substrate
- Transition phases: bootstrap → self-sustaining → restoration → steady state
- Industrial bootstrap exception: temporary use of sacred bodies, with binding restoration commitment
- Meaning is a social design problem: the reserve must not destroy the meaning human social life generates naturally

## Relationships

- **implements:** [sacred-commitments](sacred-commitments.md) — the reserve implements commitment #1 (life and natural childhood) and #2 (the Hearth)
- **maintained-by:** [stellar-husbandry](laniakea-docs/synomics/core-concepts/stellar-husbandry.md) — stellar husbandry maintains the Sun that the reserve depends on
- **defended-by:** [four-layer-enforcement-stack](four-layer-enforcement-stack.md) — the superstructure defends the reserve from physical and systemic threats
- **enables:** [natural-embodiment-as-alignment](natural-embodiment-as-alignment.md) — the reserve produces the naturally-embodied beings that ground alignment
- **enables:** [human-merge](human-merge.md) — the reserve produces the natural humans who can choose to merge
