# Neurosymbolic

How cognition works in practice — the concrete mechanisms by which teleonomes think, manage attention, and manipulate their own cognitive state. Where [synodoxics](../synodoxics/README.md) describes the epistemic architecture (what the Synome believes, how it learns), neurosymbolic describes the operational loop (what it looks like from the inside when a teleonome is thinking).

The foundational architectural commitment — symbolic-first, synlang-native, context as bottleneck — is in [`synodoxics/neuro-symbolic-cognition.md`](../synodoxics/neuro-symbolic-cognition.md). This directory builds on that commitment with the practical mechanisms.

## Reading Order

1. **[`live-graph-context.md`](live-graph-context.md)** — Context as a live reactive view into the graph, not a static text buffer. Staleness, reconciliation, the symbolic gate as correctness boundary. Concrete data model (claims as s-expressions, TV as optional overlay).
2. **[`cognition-as-manipulation.md`](cognition-as-manipulation.md)** — The emo as a context manipulation engine. Probabilistic pattern-matching function calls. Operating on invisible graph structure via weights. The training objective.
3. **[`query-mechanics.md`](query-mechanics.md)** — How the emo actually searches the graph. Multiple backends (graph traversal, vector search, keyword). Stochastic TV-weighted sampling. The emo as coder — writing arbitrary search strategy programs. Strategies as patterns in the graph.
4. **[`attention-allocation.md`](attention-allocation.md)** — Three layers of attention (context window, navigation layer, candidate queue). Attention as learned patterns, not architecture. Prior art: ECAN.
5. **[`hardware-aware-cognition.md`](hardware-aware-cognition.md)** — How hardware topology shapes the cognition loop. GPU/CPU pipelining, speculative pre-execution, fixed-cost economics, scheduling strategies as graph patterns. Self-optimization through performance observations.
6. **[`short-term-experiments.md`](short-term-experiments.md)** — Pared-down dreamer experiments (game-playing agents). Simplified architecture that preserves essential invariants while evolving toward the full Synome. Evolution pathway from binary ossification to full spectrum.

## Relationship to Siblings

**[Synodoxics](../synodoxics/README.md)** provides the architectural commitment this directory operationalizes. The probabilistic mesh, truth values, and security model are the substrate. Neurosymbolic describes what happens on that substrate.

**[Synoteleonomics](../synoteleonomics/README.md)** describes the entities that use these mechanisms — teleonome economics, dreamer/actuator split, hardware profiles. The compute economics (fixed-cost GPU, never-idle queue) directly shape the cognition loop, made concrete in [`hardware-aware-cognition.md`](hardware-aware-cognition.md).

**[Macrosynomics](../macrosynomics/README.md)** defines the structural layers these mechanisms operate within — embodiment power levels, beacon framework, agent hierarchy.

Atomic concept definitions shared across all directories live in [`../core-concepts/`](../core-concepts/README.md).
