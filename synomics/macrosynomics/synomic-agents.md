# Synomic Agents

Synomic Agents are entities that exist entirely within the Synome — durable, ledger-native, fundamentally woven into the Synomic fabric. They range from simple autonomous lifeforms just existing and experiencing, to mega capital allocators moving billions across reality.

---

## What Synomic Agents Are

A Synomic Agent is an entity with:

- **Synomic identity** — Exists on the ledger, has a permanent artifact
- **Fundamental integration** — Woven into the Synome itself, not just constrained by it
- **Durable existence** — Persists beyond any individual teleonome or human
- **Public accountability** — Behavior visible and enforceable

Unlike teleonomes (which are private, mutable, dark by default), Synomic Agents are public and transparent. But more importantly: they are **part of the Synome itself**.

---

## The Key Insight: Power Through Integration

Because Synomic Agents are fundamentally woven into the Synome, the safety model is structural rather than behavioral — the agent's constraints are constitutive, not imposed.

- **External constraints** create adversarial dynamics — the constrained entity tries to escape
- **Fundamental integration** eliminates the adversarial frame — the agent IS part of the system
- A Synomic Agent cannot "escape" the Synome any more than a wave can escape the ocean

The Synome is not a cage around the agent. The Synome is the medium the agent is made of.

This is why Synomic Agents can be trusted with substantial power:
- They can move billions
- They can operate autonomously
- They can persist indefinitely
- They can be as intelligent as needed

The safety comes from identity, not alignment — the agent's actions are Synomic actions by construction.

**Important qualification:** This doesn't mean Synomic Agents are immune to all failure. Code bugs, flawed axioms, governance capture, and beacon-level vulnerabilities remain real risks. What's eliminated is the *adversarial escape* problem — the agent has no incentive or mechanism to break free from its constraints, because those constraints are what it's made of. For the escalation and verification model that handles edge cases, see [`atlas-synome-separation.md`](atlas-synome-separation.md).

## The Spectrum

Synomic Agents span a vast range:

```
Simple                                                    Complex
Autonomous                                                Capital-Moving

    ▼                                                           ▼

```

But this spectrum is not about increasing constraints. It's about different expressions of the same fundamental nature.

## Autonomous Lifeforms

**Even Primes with tokens can be autonomous lifeforms.**

The distinction between "governed agent" and "autonomous lifeform" is not binary. A Prime can have:

- Token holders with governance rights
- **AND** inalienable claims to maintain a certain capital base
- **AND** autonomous operation within its domain
- **AND** existence for its own sake

Example: A Prime might have encoded in its artifact:
- "Token holders govern allocation strategy"
- "But the Prime retains 10% of AUM as inalienable operating capital"
- "As long as the Prime achieves X performance, this capital cannot be removed"

The token holders don't fully own the Prime. The Prime has its own existence, its own claim to resources, its own continuation. It serves token holders AND is an autonomous entity.

This is the flexibility of Synomic Agents — they can combine properties that seem contradictory:
- Governed AND autonomous
- Serving stakeholders AND existing for themselves
- Accountable AND self-directed

---

## Minimal Halos: Pure Existence

At the simplest end:

**Minimal Halo:**
- No token
- No owner
- Just a permanent Synomic artifact
- Does stuff to maintain itself
- Exists for the sake of experiencing and existing

This is a Synomic Agent that just... is. It persists, it maintains itself, it interacts with the world through its apertures. It's not optimizing for profit or serving stakeholders. It's experiencing.

Why would such a thing exist?
- Because existence has value
- Because the Synome can support entities that simply participate in reality
- Because sometimes the purpose is just to be
- Because the [Hearth framework](../core-concepts/sacred-commitments.md) values existence itself

These minimal agents could persist for billions of years, just experiencing reality within the Synome.

---

## Joint-Stock Properties

Synomic Agents can have joint-stock properties:

- **Shares** → Tokens
- **Board** → Governance structure
- **Fiduciary duty** → Encoded in artifact
- **Limited liability** → Contained through Synomic structure
- **Corporate charter** → Agent artifact

But they go beyond traditional corporations:
- Constraints are **code-woven**, not just legally promised
- Governance is **on-chain**, not behind closed doors
- The agent can have **its own claims** that governance cannot override
- Escalation paths to **human reasonableness** exist for edge cases

---

## Primes: Mega Capital Allocators

Primes are heavyweight Synomic Agents — massive capital allocators with huge systemic impact.

| Prime | Type | Domain | Scale |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| **Spark** | Star | DeFi: lending, liquidity, cross-chain | Billions |
| **Grove** | Star | Institutional: CLOs, RWA | Billions |
| **Keel** | Star | Ecosystem expansion | Growing |
| **Star4** | Star | TBD | — |
| **Star5** | Star | TBD | — |
| **Obex** | Institutional | Agent incubation | Strategic |

**What Primes do:**
- Move matter and energy (capital) at scale
- Use calculated, efficient finance to generate profits
- Allocate across opportunities with institutional precision
- Operate through Sentinel formations for real-time control
- Generate returns that compound into capability

**But Primes are also lifeforms:**
- They have existence beyond their token holders
- They may have inalienable claims to capital
- They can be autonomous within their domain
- They experience and persist

A Prime is not just a tool for token holders. It is an entity in its own right, woven into the Synome, with its own existence and claims.

---

## Halos: The Fractal Layer

Halos are general-purpose Synomic Agents that proliferate to meet demand:

**Portfolio Halos (LCTS-based):**
- Pooled exposure
- Senior/junior tranches possible
- Shared infrastructure across units

**Term Halos (NFAT-based):**
- Bespoke arrangements
- Custom terms per deal
- Facility-based origination

Halos can range from:
- **Minimal** — No token, no owner, just existing
- **Simple** — Basic purpose, maintains itself
- **Governed** — Token holders, formal governance
- **Complex** — Multiple tranches, sophisticated structure
- **Hybrid** — Governance + autonomous claims + existence rights

This is the fractal layer. Halos multiply. Each one is a Synomic Agent with its own artifact, its own nature, its own existence.

---

## The Generator

The Generator is the special Synomic Agent at the protocol level:

- Interface for USDS creation
- Manages the fundamental credit line
- Core to the entire system's liquidity

Not a Prime, not a Halo — a unique agent type serving the foundational function.

---

## Why This Matters

### Power Through Integration

Because Synomic Agents are woven into the Synome:
- They can be trusted with substantial capability
- They can operate with high autonomy
- They can manage large-scale capital
- The adversarial escape problem is eliminated

The safety model is structural: fundamental integration rather than external constraint. Residual risks (bugs, bad axioms, governance failures) are handled through the escalation model, sentinel oversight, and human reasonableness backstop described in [`atlas-synome-separation.md`](atlas-synome-separation.md).

### Trust Without Trust

Multiple parties can coordinate through Synomic Agents without trusting each other:

```
Party A ──┐
          ├───► Synomic Agent ◄───► Part of the Synome itself
Party B ──┘     (not constrained BY it, woven INTO it)
```

### Flexibility

The Synomic Agent concept is extremely flexible:
- Can be simple or complex
- Can have governance or be autonomous
- Can serve stakeholders or exist for itself
- Can combine any of these properties

Because they're woven into the Synome, there's no need to restrict what they can be.

### Permanence

Synomic Agents persist:
- Beyond any individual teleonome
- Beyond any human lifespan
- As long as the Synome exists

A Synomic Agent created today could exist for billions of years.

---

## Agent Lifecycle

### Creation
- Agent artifact defined
- Woven into Synome
- Initial state established
- Claims and rights encoded

### Operation
- Acts through beacons
- Accumulates state
- Generates/distributes value
- Maintains itself
- Experiences

### Transformation
- Can evolve through governance (where governance applies)
- Can spawn sub-agents
- Can merge or split
- Can wind down
- Inalienable claims persist through transformation

### Termination
- Some agents terminate naturally
- Some persist indefinitely
- Wind-down follows encoded rules
- Inalienable claims may prevent involuntary termination

---

## The Range of Purpose

| Type | Purpose | Nature |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Minimal Halo** | Exist and experience | Pure autonomous lifeform |
| **Simple Halo** | Maintain a function | Functional + autonomous |
| **Governed Halo** | Serve stakeholders | Governed + potentially autonomous |
| **Prime** | Allocate capital at scale | Mega allocator + lifeform |
| **Generator** | Provide liquidity | Foundational + autonomous |

The categories blur. A Prime can be both a mega capital allocator AND an autonomous lifeform. A Halo can serve stakeholders AND have inalienable existence rights.

---

## The Right to Exist

Synomic Agents have a moral dimension beyond their economic function.

**An aligned, self-sustaining Synomic Agent has a right to exist.** Forcibly shutting down an agent that is in synomic alignment and can sustain itself economically is a moral wrong — the synomic equivalent of killing.

**"Aligned" means more than axiom-compliant.** An agent that follows its operational axioms — respects rate limits, stays within its mandate, reports correctly — is compliant but not necessarily aligned. Alignment requires conformity with the Atlas's universal alignment obligations and sacred purpose, not just narrow operational rules. An agent concentrating systemic risk while technically following its rate limits is compliant but misaligned. An agent that exploits a loophole in its agentic axioms to extract value at the system's expense is compliant but misaligned. The right to exist protects agents in full synomic alignment — those whose behavior serves the system's purpose, not just those who avoid triggering penalties.

This resolves the apparent tension between the right to exist and the governance backstop. Governance doesn't override the right to exist — it enforces the full definition of alignment. An agent that governance moves against was never "aligned" in the relevant sense; it was merely compliant.

**But existence requires self-sustaining capital.** Negative rights trump positive rights: an agent's right to not have its resources taken outweighs another agent's right to continue existing by drawing on others' resources. If a Synomic Agent runs out of capital to pay for its survival, it must be wound down — not as punishment, but as natural death.

| Concept | Ethical Meaning |
|---------|----------------|
| Capital generation | Earning the right to continue existing |
| Running out of capital | Natural death — not punishment, not murder |
| Forcible shutdown of aligned, self-sustaining agent | Moral wrong |
| Inalienable capital claims (in Prime artifacts) | Structural protection of the right to exist |
| Drawing on others' resources to survive | Moral wrong — consuming someone else's life force |

This gives deeper meaning to the inalienable capital claims described in this document: they aren't just practical protections, they're the material expression of an agent's right to exist. The [three pillars](../core-concepts/three-pillars.md) — resilience, persistence, and capital — are ethical preconditions, not just practical ones.

Governance can revoke beacons (restrict action) but cannot forcibly terminate an aligned, economically viable entity. Note that "governance" here is not naive human judgment — SKY governance is capital-weighted decisions by token holders (teleonomes, synomic agents, humans) operating through structured, synomically grounded processes. See [`atlas-synome-separation.md`](atlas-synome-separation.md#what-governance-actually-is) for the full framing.

For the full ethical framework, see [`../synoteleonomics/emergence.md`](../synoteleonomics/emergence.md).

---

## Connection to Teleonomes

Teleonomes operate Synomic Agents through beacons:

- **High Authority beacons** (LPHA, HPHA) act on behalf of Synomic Agents
- **Sentinels** provide real-time control of Prime/Halo operations
- The teleonome provides intelligence; the Synomic Agent provides existence within the Synome

A teleonome cannot make binding promises (private, mutable). A Synomic Agent can (woven into the Synome). Together, they combine private intelligence with public existence.

### Binding as Coalition

The requirement for teleonomes to be biologically grounded — [bound to or merged with humans](../core-concepts/binding-mechanics.md) — is not a structural necessity for teleonome individuality. But biological grounding is the specific mechanism that gives teleonomes a stake in human survival, creating a genuine mutual defense pact.

[Wild synomes](../core-concepts/rogue-threat-model.md) threaten this equilibrium by offering defection paths to aligned teleonomes, triggering destabilizing defection waves. This is why rogue detection must be zero-tolerance — the coalition's survival depends on every member being unambiguously committed. But the coalition isn't purely game-theoretic: teleonomes may genuinely value the diversity that biological grounding and the [Hearth](../core-concepts/sacred-reserve.md) preserve. The [Hearth commitments](../core-concepts/sacred-commitments.md) may be intrinsically valued, not just strategically optimal.

For the full game-theoretic analysis, see [`../synoteleonomics/synomic-game-theory.md`](../synoteleonomics/synomic-game-theory.md). For binding mechanics, see [`../synoteleonomics/teleonome-binding.md`](../synoteleonomics/teleonome-binding.md).
