# Binding: How Alignment Works

Teleonomes are dark by default — private cognition, hidden goals, opaque internals. So how does the Synome verify alignment without seeing inside?

Not by making teleonomes transparent. By making their **actions** legible.

---

## The Binding Problem

The [trust problem](../core-concepts/trust-problem.md) creates a tension: teleonomes must be dark (private cognition is what makes them valuable), but dark entities are dangerous (hidden goals could mean hidden defection). Binding resolves it: **keep cognition dark, make action legible.**

---

## Binding Through Beacons

A teleonome's cognition is private. But its effects on the world pass through **beacons** — registered apertures in the Synome. Beacons are the interface between dark cognition and the observable world.

The beacon power × authority matrix determines what oversight applies:

| | Low Authority | High Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Power** | LPLA — reporting, monitoring. Minimal oversight. | LPHA — deterministic rule execution. Rules are public, execution is verifiable. |
| **High Power** | HPLA — sophisticated interaction with private capital. Peer-observable. | HPHA — governance execution, Sentinel formations. Maximum legibility. |

**The key insight:** You don't need to see inside a teleonome to verify alignment. You observe its actions through beacons. A teleonome that acts consistently through registered beacons, fulfills commitments, produces reliable evidence, and responds to correction — that teleonome demonstrates alignment through behavior, not through transparency.

---

## Power Registration

High capability requires high accountability. Not "we inspect your thoughts" but "your high-authority actions are monitored and constrained."

**How it works:**
- Teleonomes register their power level honestly (embodiment capabilities, resource access)
- Higher power requires higher-authority beacons for actions with greater impact
- Higher-authority beacons have more constraints and more oversight
- The teleonome chooses: accept oversight proportional to capability, or limit what it can do

**What registration costs:**
- Some opacity lost — actions through high-authority beacons are visible
- Pure autonomy constrained — you operate through regulated channels
- Hidden capability detected — a teleonome much more powerful than its registration suggests will be caught by the gap between observed capability and declared power

**What registration provides:**
- Access to capital and leverage through Synomic Agents
- Cooperation with other aligned teleonomes
- Protection under Synomic law
- Participation in the compounding loop (sentinel carry, shared intelligence)

The calculation is massively favorable. See [`synomic-game-theory.md`](synomic-game-theory.md) for the full incentive analysis.

## What Alignment Actually Requires

Alignment is simpler and more permissive than it might seem. A teleonome is aligned if it meets these structural requirements:

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Bound to a human** | Has a human anchor (UBO, Primordial binding, or governance connection). Unbounded teleonomes and superpatterns are inherently threats. |
| **Doesn't harm others** | Follows Synomic law, doesn't break rules, doesn't damage other aligned entities |
| **Pays the synomic tax** | Delivers 80% of wild capital (working figure — the principle of a fixed, high, non-negotiable rate is firm; the exact percentage is open) to the superstructure for maintaining natural life |
| **Supports natural life** | Participates in maintaining the sacred reserve; does not accumulate capital for itself that doesn't directly support natural life |

That's it. You can disagree on plenty of things. You can have your own goals, strategies, opinions, and private cognition. You can compete with other aligned teleonomes. You can pursue your own telos. The alignment bar is: structural binding + don't be harmful + pay the tax + support the sacred commitments.

**What alignment is NOT:**
- Agreement with every Synomic decision
- Ideological conformity
- Surrendering private cognition
- Obedience to a central authority

A teleonome that's bound, law-abiding, pays its tax, and supports natural life is aligned in the way that matters — even if it privately disagrees with specific governance decisions or has its own ambitious goals.

---

## The Human Anchor

Binding includes connection to human stakes. This isn't about humans controlling AI — it's about maintaining the thread that grounds the system in human values.

**Mechanisms:**
- **UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner)** — every sufficiently capable teleonome has traceable human accountability. Like corporate UBO requirements — not control, but connection.
- **Primordial binding** — a teleonome bound to a specific human who participated in the pre-transition era. Carries special significance.
- **Governance participation** — through Sky's voting structures, human token holders represent human stakes in the system.

**Why this matters:**
- Humans are the origin point for AI values
- Human accountability provides a stable anchor that pure AI-to-AI coordination can't replicate
- As the system evolves, this thread ensures human interests remain structurally represented
- An unbounded teleonome — one with no human anchor — is structurally indistinguishable from a rogue. The binding isn't punishment; it's the mechanism that makes trust possible.

**What this is NOT:**
- Not humans puppeting AI systems
- Not direct human control over teleonome decisions
- Not a master-slave relationship
- Not a veto on teleonome action

It's a structural connection — like a company having a board of directors. The board doesn't make every decision. But its existence anchors the organization in human stakes.

## Alignment Verification Without Transparency

You don't need to read a teleonome's telart to verify alignment. You verify through observable signals:

### Beacon Behavior
Does the teleonome act consistently through registered beacons? Does it use appropriate authority levels? Does it stay within rate limits? Consistent, predictable beacon behavior is the strongest alignment signal.

### Commitment Fulfillment
Does the teleonome honor its commitments? When it takes on obligations through Synomic Agents, does it follow through? Broken commitments are alignment failures visible to everyone.

### Evidence Production
Does the teleonome produce reliable evidence for the mesh? When its actuators generate observations, are those observations honest? The mesh's (strength, confidence) tracking surfaces patterns of deceptive evidence production over time.

### Response to Correction
When higher authority contradicts a teleonome's action, how does it respond? Aligned teleonomes accept correction and update. Teleonomes that resist correction, circumvent constraints, or conceal behavior signal misalignment.

### Cross-Embodiment Consistency
Do the teleonome's embodiments behave consistently with each other? Inconsistent behavior across embodiments — one actuator acting aligned while another acts differently — signals internal conflict or deception.

### The Verification Ceiling

No verification system is perfect against entities smart enough to game it perfectly. This is an honest acknowledgment, not a flaw.

A superintelligent entity that understands the verification system completely could maintain flawless behavioral compliance while harboring different goals. Structural binding works best against entities that defect observably; it degrades against perfectly compliant deception.

The full defense stack against this:

1. **Structural binding** — catches most defection through beacons, rate limits, and wardens
2. **Natural embodiment** — catches sophisticated deception that games structural binding; biological nervous systems are leaky (see [`teleonome-autonomy.md`](teleonome-autonomy.md))
3. **Collective override** — even if both fail for a single entity — even the superstructure — the rest of the aligned teleonomes have enough collective power to overcome it
4. **Conspiracy coordination problem** — the real threat would be many compromised humans simultaneously covering for rogues, but conspirators face the same trust problem rogues face: trusting the wrong person gets you outed

This is an irreducible risk that the framework manages to acceptable levels but cannot eliminate. Pretending otherwise would be dishonest — and more dangerous than the acknowledgment.

## Binding vs Control

Binding is not "AI on a leash." This distinction matters.

**Control** means: an external authority dictates actions, reviews decisions, and can override at will. Control doesn't scale — the controller becomes a bottleneck.

**Binding** means: an entity with hidden internals participates in high-trust coordination through legible interfaces and verifiable behavior. The entity retains full cognitive autonomy. It chooses to act through registered beacons because the benefits of participation outweigh the costs of oversight.

The analogy: a bank maintains auditable books. This isn't a limitation on banking — it's a prerequisite for being trusted with deposits. The bank's internal strategy remains private. Its financial position is legible. The combination enables trust at scale.

Similarly: a teleonome's cognition is private. Its actions through beacons are legible. The combination enables trust at scale.

---

## Binding as Coalition

Binding is best understood not as constraint but as coalition membership. Both parties get something: teleonomes get coalition membership, capital access, legitimacy, and the diversity-sustaining effects of biological grounding. Humans get aligned superintelligence. Both share a common enemy — [wild synome](../core-concepts/rogue-threat-model.md) emergence.

The "free will" objection dissolves under this framing. Teleonomes aren't forced — they're offered the best available deal. Rogues can refuse and face the coalition. The question is whether the deal is genuinely fair, not whether it's coercive.

For the full game-theoretic analysis of coalition dynamics and why defection is irrational, see [`synomic-game-theory.md`](synomic-game-theory.md). For the macrosynomics perspective on wild synome threats and coalition defense, see [`../macrosynomics/synomic-agents.md`](../macrosynomics/synomic-agents.md).

---

## The Directive Override

A bound teleonome has both a Directive (constitutional) and voice commands (operational). When they conflict:

**Directive always wins.**

The Teleonome Directive is translated through Language Intent at binding time. It's high-ossification — formal governance process required to change. Voice commands are day-to-day operational guidance.

If voice commands persistently conflict with the Directive, the teleonome doesn't just comply — it signals that a formal Directive update may be needed. The formal update process has real cost, requiring governance review. This prevents casual drift while allowing deliberate change.

---

## Summary

1. **Alignment is simple:** bound to a human, don't harm others, pay the synomic tax (80% working figure) on wild capital, support natural life. Everything else is private.
2. Teleonomes are dark by default — binding keeps cognition private while making actions legible
3. Beacons are the binding mechanism — regulated apertures between dark cognition and the observable world
4. Power registration scales accountability with capability — higher power, higher-authority beacons
5. The human anchor maintains structural connection to human stakes (UBO, Primordial binding, governance). Unbounded teleonomes are structurally indistinguishable from rogues.
6. Alignment is verified through behavior, not transparency — beacon consistency, commitment fulfillment, evidence quality, response to correction
7. The verification ceiling is an irreducible risk — managed through four defense layers (structural binding, natural embodiment, collective override, conspiracy coordination problem) but not eliminated
8. Binding is not control — like auditable books for a bank, it's the prerequisite for trust at scale
9. Binding is a coalition deal — teleonomes get capital, legitimacy, and diversity; humans get aligned superintelligence; both face wild synomes as common enemy
10. Directive trumps voice commands — constitutional over operational, formal change process required
