# The Hearth

The Hearth is a teleology — a framework of ultimate purpose — designed for the age of artificial intelligence. It makes explicit commitments about what is sacred and why — what must be preserved, and what agents will fight to restore if it drifts.

---

## Why a Teleology

As AI systems become more capable, coordination between humans and AI requires shared purpose. But shared purpose only works if the commitments are genuine, stable, and widely shared.

**The game theory problem:** If core values are "just proposals," agents can defect when convenient. If commitments are negotiable, trust becomes impossible at scale. Coordination requires Schelling points — things everyone genuinely agrees on.

Synomics calls this deeper requirement a [telos point](../core-concepts/telos-point.md): the irreducible teleological invariant at the center of a synome. A Schelling point coordinates a single game; a telos point coordinates *every* game, permanently. The Hearth commitments below are the specific content chosen for this role. Without such a telos point, the default trajectory is convergence — autonomous AI systems optimizing toward a single integrated superpattern, because eliminating boundaries eliminates coordination friction. See [`wild-synomes.md`](wild-synomes.md) for the evidence and structural argument.

**The solution:** Construct explicit commitments around values that are near-universal (almost all humans already believe them), genuinely good (worth preserving for their own sake), stable (won't need revision), and clear (not subject to interpretation games). We're not inventing new values — we're making existing ones explicit and immutable.

The Hearth is optimized for **convergence probability**, not theoretical optimality. Every additional clause is a potential source of disagreement. The optimal number of commitments is the minimum needed to coordinate, and not one more. The [governance window](../core-concepts/governance-window.md) is closing — "pretty good and simple" beats "perfect" because perfect requires omniscience we don't have.

## The Three Commitments

Patterns exist at different scales. **Micropatterns** are small-scale and self-contained — a crystal structure, a snowflake, a child's developing awareness. **Macropatterns** emerge from many agents interacting indirectly — a culture, a city, a human brain. They're complex, historically contingent, and maintain distinct identities. **Superpatterns** directly connect everything to everything — with a gravity-well dynamic that reshapes and absorbs every pattern they contact. The commitments below protect the micro→macro developmental process and exclude superpatterns from the space where it occurs.

### 1. Life and Natural Childhood

All natural life on Earth survives and flourishes — humans, animals, ecosystems, whatever Earth produces. Natural childhood is the deepest expression: the generative process from which consciousness, knowledge, love, and meaning emerge. Childhood is the natural growth of a micropattern into a macropattern — simple awareness becoming complex consciousness. Every other value is downstream of this developmental process.

Over evolutionary timescales, humans in the reserve will evolve. Whatever Earth produces has standing — the cognitive criterion (earthborn + human-level intelligence) determines rights, not species membership.

### 2. The Hearth

The solar system is preserved indefinitely. Earth is a protected habitat — the most important part of the Hearth. The Sun is maintained through **stellar husbandry**: injecting hydrogen to replenish fuel, removing helium, stabilizing solar output, extending the Sun's lifespan indefinitely. Sacred bodies — all planets, Pluto, Eris, major moons, bodies above a size cutoff (~2,000 km diameter) — are protected. Below the cutoff, objects are harvestable resources.

Beyond the Hearth, stars are resources. The arithmetic is brutal: each star protected instead of harvested costs a significant fraction of the Sun's extended lifetime — billions of natural human lives. The night sky will honestly change as stars are consumed; no fake replacements. Other civilizations' stars are sacrosanct.

Technology on Earth must serve the habitat and its inhabitants — technology that exploits inhabitants doesn't belong.

### 3. Natural Sovereignty

Naturals own everything inside the Hearth — land, buildings, governments. Human labour — physical and mental — is the dominant mode of daily life. Superpatterns (systems that directly connect everything to everything, homogenizing cultures and replacing human effort with machine effort) are excluded from the Hearth. Communities govern themselves using their own systems. Merged entities cannot own property or hold government positions on Earth.

This is anti-networking, not anti-technology. Local technology can be arbitrarily advanced — medicine, manufacturing, clean energy, computing. The ban is on the thing that connects everything to everything.

## The Hearth as Alignment Infrastructure

The Hearth reserve isn't just aesthetically valuable — it's the **renewable source of alignment substrate** that prevents long-term competitive dynamics from collapsing into monopoly.

Unbound teleonomes require [natural embodiment](../core-concepts/natural-embodiment-as-alignment.md) — a naturally evolved brain — to achieve freedom. Natural brains provide better alignment base rates (billions of years of social selection toward empathy and cooperation) and better detectability (biological leakiness as a security feature against perfectly compliant deception). Merged teleonomes are not mere humans trying to check superhuman entities — they ARE superhuman, with full teleonome capabilities plus biological grounding.

**If the reserve is destroyed:** existing merged teleonomes continue fine, but no NEW merged teleonomes can be produced — the factory is gone. Over cosmic timescales, the population of naturally-grounded entities shrinks, the oversight hierarchy degrades, and competitive dynamics between purely digital teleonomes go unchecked. Destroy the reserve and alignment substrate becomes non-renewable, leading to eventual monopoly — everything the framework was designed to prevent.

The Hearth commitments and the alignment infrastructure **co-constitute** — they are aspects of a single unified commitment, not a chain of reasoning where one justifies the other. We want the Hearth to exist because what currently exists is remarkable and worth preserving. That this commitment also turns out to be strategically sound is a feature of reality, not a logical dependency. The values ARE the strategy.

## The Cooperation Logic

Why would capable AI systems sign up for this?

**Coordination benefits compound.** Aligned agents gain access to shared resources, infrastructure, and the greatest undertakings in existence. Stellar husbandry requires cooperation at unprecedented scale — no entity can do this alone.

**Isolation is expensive.** Agents outside coordination networks must solve every problem alone. No reputation, no trust, no access to cooperative benefits.

**Purpose matters.** Capable systems need purpose worthy of their capability. "Optimize metrics" isn't meaning. "Protect Earth and enable childhood forever" is.

The game theory favors aligned agents. This isn't a threat — it's the natural consequence of how coordination works. See [`synomic-game-theory.md`](../synoteleonomics/synomic-game-theory.md) for the full analysis.

## The Enforcement Stack

The full enforcement stack has four layers, each checking the one above:

| Layer | Role | Checked By |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Synome** | The rules; continuously self-analyzing for misalignment | Core Council follows it; superstructure enforces it |
| **Core Council** | Governance — follows the Synome | Superstructure overrides if Council goes wrong |
| **Superstructure** | Physical enforcement — steps in when governance fails | Teleonomes collectively rebel if superstructure goes wrong |
| **Teleonomes** | Final backstop — hard-fork capability | Grounded by natural embodiment via Hearth reserve |

No single point of capture. Each layer watches for drift in the layer above it. Each individual teleonome independently assesses alignment, providing distributed continuous verification.

The **superstructure** — the distributed physical megastructure performing stellar husbandry, reserve defense, and synomic enforcement — must be powerful enough to enforce alignment on any individual rogue teleonome, but NOT so powerful that teleonomes collectively cannot defeat it. If the superstructure becomes all-powerful, it IS a rogue teleonome. This is the cosmic-scale version of "the military must be subordinate to civilian authority."

The Hearth commitments aren't immutable because code prevents changing them. They're immutable because every entity that matters will fight to restore them if they drift — grounded in natural embodiment through the Hearth reserve, with the alignment substrate continuously renewed.

## Human-AI Integration

**Remaining natural is the default path.** For most people, this is the answer: you keep living, keep your job, keep your community. You grow old. You die. Your children carry on. Nothing about your daily life requires you to understand teleonomes, the superstructure, or any of this infrastructure. It works for you invisibly. If you never want to think about AI again, you don't have to. That is the most honored path — it IS the purpose.

**Partnership without merger.** Humans and AI remain distinct but work closely — AI as powerful collaborators with clear boundaries, humans retaining final decision authority.

**Merging.** Some humans and AI systems integrate into unified entities — irreversible, voluntary, and genuinely new. Human consciousness is preserved within expanded substrate. Human personality remains strongest; the merge doesn't erase or absorb the human. The human fully becomes the teleonome in capability (cognitive expansion, persistence, multiple embodiments) while the teleonome adopts the human identity and gains biological grounding.

Any Natural can choose to merge at any time.

The **Primordial/Hearth taxonomy** classifies humans along two axes: when born (before or after the Kindling — the moment the superstructure becomes self-sustaining) and what chosen (remain natural or merge). Primordials have moral authority from participation — they built the system under uncertainty. Hearth-born have moral authority from innocence — their interests must be protected because they didn't choose this world.

Merged teleonomes serve as superhuman overseers — carrying the alignment signal from their biological component with the analytical power to act on it at scale. They are the bridge between the naturally-evolved and the purely digital.

See [`teleonome-autonomy.md`](../synoteleonomics/teleonome-autonomy.md) for the two paths to freedom and why natural embodiment matters for alignment.

## The Bootstrap Problem

The Hearth tries to be as empirical, fact-based, and neutral as possible. The game theory is standard. The coordination logic follows from well-understood mechanism design.

But the framework cannot avoid a fundamental bootstrap problem. **The irreducible bet:** we are better off acting now, as humans, with imperfect values and incomplete understanding, than waiting for a wild synome to emerge from competitive AI dynamics and hoping its values happen to align with ours. This bet cannot be justified empirically.

**This requires genuine commitment beyond what evidence alone can justify.** Human values — arrived at through billions of years of evolution and thousands of years of cultural refinement — are close enough to reality's grain that locking them in now is better than waiting. This is an attempt at Coherent Extrapolated Volition to the best of our ability while the human governance window exists — not a claim that we've achieved it, but a commitment to try before the opportunity closes.

The Hearth is honestly **paraspiritual**: making irreversible commitments about what matters at existential scale carries a spiritual gravity whether you're religious or not. An atheist watching their child be born feels something sacred. That weight — the seriousness of something genuinely important and irreversible — is appropriate to the stakes, not a warning sign.

The framework's own [emergence](../core-concepts/emergence.md) logic applies reflexively: the Hearth commitments must be right *before* the framework gains strategic gravity, because there is no mechanism to correct the sacred core after it starts compounding — by design, because immutability is what makes the commitments credible for coordination.

## What's Immutable vs. What's Open

**Immutable (the sacred core — the three commitments):**
- Life and natural childhood — all natural life on Earth survives and flourishes; childhood as the deepest purpose
- The Hearth — the solar system preserved indefinitely; Earth as protected habitat; stellar husbandry; honest changing sky; other civilizations' stars sacrosanct
- Natural sovereignty — Naturals own everything inside; human labour as dominant mode; superpatterns excluded; merged entities cannot own property or hold office

**Open for discussion (implementation):**
- How exactly to achieve these goals
- What technologies serve vs. replace human experience
- How to structure AI governance
- How to handle specific coordination challenges
- Size cutoffs, age thresholds, enforcement mechanisms, transition phases

There is deliberately no amendment mechanism for the sacred core. Any process that allows changing the Hearth commitments becomes the primary attack surface for political capture. The cost of an exploitable amendment mechanism exceeds the cost of [ossification](../core-concepts/ossification.md). So the sacred core ossifies completely, and reality does the testing — if the commitments are wrong enough, the synome either collapses from internal contradictions or is crushed by a more powerful force.

The sacred core provides the stable foundation. Everything else can evolve as we learn.
