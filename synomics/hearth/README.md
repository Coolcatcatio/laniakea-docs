# The Hearth

The teleological framework — what all of this is for. Why autonomous AI needs a sacred purpose, what the commitments are, and why they're load-bearing for alignment.

**Entry point for:** Purpose/philosophy audiences. For teleonome design and economics, see [`../synoteleonomics/`](../synoteleonomics/README.md). For system-level architecture, see [`../macrosynomics/`](../macrosynomics/README.md).

## Documents

| Doc | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| [hearth](hearth.md) | The three commitments, alignment infrastructure argument, enforcement stack, human-AI integration, cooperation logic, bootstrap problem |
| [wild-synomes](wild-synomes.md) | The counterfactual — what happens without the Hearth: the superpattern attractor, observable precursors, the financial trust pathway to convergence |

`hearth.md` is the core argument. `wild-synomes.md` is the counterfactual that motivates it. Detailed speculative operations (reserve geography, enforcement proxies, ground-time economics, merge mechanics, judgment/eschatology) exist separately and are not required for the philosophical argument.
